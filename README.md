## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/michaeltanus96/to-do.git
cd to-do
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the front-end directory and install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Backend Server
The back-end server needs to be run locally. From the project root, navigate to the server directory and start the server:
```bash
node backend/server.js
```
By default, the server runs on `http://localhost:3000`.

### 4. Run the Frontend
Deploy the front-end locally by running the following command:
```bash
npm start
```
The front-end application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## API Endpoints

The application communicates with the back-end server via the following RESTful API endpoints:

### 1. **GET /api/todos**
- Retrieves all to-do items.

### 2. **POST /api/todos**
- Adds a new to-do item.
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Sample To-Do Item"
  }
  ```

### 3. **DELETE /api/todos/:id**
- Deletes a to-do item by its ID.
